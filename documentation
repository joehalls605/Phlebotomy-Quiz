  /* 
  This code defines a function called shuffleQuestions that takes an array as its argument and shuffles the elements of the array using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm (also known as the Knuth shuffle). 
The purpose of shuffling is to randomize the order of elements in the array.


The for loop iterates over the elements of the array in reverse order. Starting from the last element and going up to the second element.

const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
Inside the loop, a random index is generate, this index is between 0 and the current value of i.
This is achieved by getting a random decimal between one and 0, then multiplying it by i + 1. Math.floor then rounds it down to the nearest integer.

[array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];. This swaps the elements at indicies i and j. This efficiently changes the position of two elements without needing a temporary variable.
